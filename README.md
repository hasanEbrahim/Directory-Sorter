# Directory-Sorter
Script that sorts directory based on file extension.

Simple script that organizes a directory.

On script run asks user to enter the PATH to be organized, then sorts the directory based on file extension.

Updated to make installation easier and more accessible.

Converted the python script into an executable. 

How to use:

- Download Stack folder
- Open the dist folder
- Run the Stack.exe
- You should be prompted to enter the Directory that needs to be sorted.
  Files should be organized based on the file extension.

Thats it!

Made while practicing Python automation.
