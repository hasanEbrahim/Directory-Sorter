# Directory-Sorter
Script that sorts directory based on file extension (*.exe).

Simple script that organizes a directory.

On script run asks user to enter the PATH to be organized, then sorts the directory based on file extension.

Python must be installed!

How to use:

Open command prompt and go to the Directory where script is stored in.

Next, type python stack.py

You should be prompted to enter the Directory that needs to be sorted.
Files should be organized based on the file extension.

Thats it!

Made while practicing Python automation.
